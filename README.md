Android ActiveNotifications Sample
===================================

Notification Groups and the Notification Manager can be used together to simplify
how users experience notifications. This sample demonstrates how
the NotificationManager can tell you how many notifications your
application is currently showing. It also shows how to manage the
notifications as a group and introduce a summary for the group, when
supported by the platform.

Introduction
------------

Notifications can now be grouped.

Starting with Android N, you can set notification groups for notifications
and define a notification group summary.

In Android M, you can query for the active notifications that your app sent
using the [notify][2] methods.

This sample demonstrates simple use of these features by allowing a user
to add notifications and then query how many notifications
are currently being displayed via the [getActiveNotifications()][3] method.
